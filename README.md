Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for increasing the chances of successful treatment.Image processing techniques, particularly when combined with machine learning algorithms, have shown promising results in detecting lung cancer cells from medical images like CT scans.
Here are some of the key image processing techniques employed in lung cancer detection:
1.Image Pre-processing: removal of noise 
2.Image Segmentation: separating the resion of intrest
3.Feature Extraction: perform degitel operatios on given image like grayscale image to binary conveersion, complimanting, clearing boundary etc.
